Description: unix-way toolset for recovering and converting filesystems
 anyfs-tools allows you to recover and convert filesystems while using
 minimal extra disk space. Unlike other recovery tools, anyfs-tools
 doesn't copy all the files found on other disks (or partitions), but
 only saves information about the location of the file blocks to an
 external inode table. After recovery, a user may mount the damaged
 filesystem with anyfs and the external inode table and then interact
 with all recovered files with any program.
