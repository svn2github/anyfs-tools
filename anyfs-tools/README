anyfs-tools -- unix-way toolset for recovering and converting filesystems
for Linux OS.

To install this program, type the following commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

The hash symbol (#) means that this command must be run as root.

If you want to edit the source code, run the following command as well:
$ make depend

The package has the following library dependencies:
 * e2fsprogs v1.38 (includes libext2fs, libe2p, libuuid, libblkid)
 * xfsprogs v2.8.11 (includes libxfs, libdisk)
		(optionally, for converting to XFS)
 * libbz2 (optionally, for recovering BZIP2 files)
 * libmpeg2 (optionally, for recovering MPEG2 stream)

If you have older e2fsprogs or xfsprogs version, it is preferable to update it.
If you have newer version, but the package does not compile, send me a note
(see below).

Before building you may want to change some settings in files:
anyfs-tools/src/anysurrect/surrectlist.conf
anyfs-tools/src/anysurrect/config.h

anyfs kernel module building was tested on kernels 2.6.9-2.6.17.
The module installs to file
/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/fs/any/any.ko

You need to have linux kernel source for building.
So if you use distributive linux kernel, before building you need to install
kernel-source package.

After installing the package, read the manual:
$ man anyfs-tools

If you have problems compiling this program, write to me at undefer@gmail.com
