anyfs-tools -- unix-way toolset for recovering and converting filesystems
for Linux OS.

To install this program, type the following commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

The hash symbol (#) means that this command must be run as root.

If you want to edit the source code, run the following command as well:
$ make depend

The package has the following library dependencies:
 * e2fsprogs v1.38 (includes libext2fs, libe2p, libuuid, libblkid)
 * xfsprogs v2.8.11 (includes libxfs, libdisk)
		(optionally, for converting to XFS)
 * libbz2 (optionally, for recovering BZIP2 files)
 * libmpeg2 (optionally, for recovering MPEG2 stream)
 * FUSE >= 2.5.0 for anyfuse module building.

If you have an older e2fsprogs or xfsprogs version, it is preferable to update it.
If you have a newer version, but the package does not compile, send me a note
(see below).

WARNING! In package 0.85.1b version building of build_fs 
temporarily disabled while I cannot restore its
correct work with xfsprogs 3.x.
You can use anyfs-tools early versions to use
build_xfs with xfsprogs 2.x.

Before building you may want to change some settings in files:
anyfs-tools/src/anysurrect/surrectlist.conf
anyfs-tools/src/anysurrect/config.h

After installing the package, read the manual:
$ man anyfs-tools

If you have problems compiling this program, write to me at undefer@gmail.com
